1-Save As:

When saving the file in your text editor, choose the "Save As" option instead of "Save" or "Save File."

2-Specify File Type:

In the "Save As" dialog, look for an option to specify the file type or file extension. Choose "All Files" or a similar option, and manually enter the filename as .gitignore (without the .txt extension).

3-Save:

After specifying the file type and setting the filename to .gitignore, click the "Save" button.

This way, you explicitly save the file with the desired name and extension, preventing the text editor from appending a .txt extension.
